## Getting started ##

This is a elementary but not trivial Rails 3.1 app. To run it locally, you need a Ruby installation and the bundler gem installed. To install:

    git clone https://github.com/Shopify/batman-classifieds.git
    cd batman-classifieds
    bundle install
    bundle exec rake db:setup
    bundle exec demo:reset # optional (test data)
    bundle exec rails server

## About  ##

Batman Classifieds is a good example of a simple Batman application and how to best integrate batman with Rails. It uses the `batman-rails` gem to source batman's javascripts, and Sprockets to package it all up. 

There's two major resources: Ads, and Users, which are exposed via JSON endpoints
and accessed using a `Batman.RailsStorage` adapter. 

Ads are a typical CRUD resource, whereas Users are session based and exposed via the
`ApplicationController` talking to OmniAuth.


## Extra notes ##

If you're using AdBlock you're going to want to disable it while using this website. Some of divs have an id of 'show-ad' which is blocked via the extension.

If you run into an error such as this:  
ActionView::Template::Error (Couldn't find User with id=2), make sure to clear your browser cache. This can happen if you run the app, login, reset the db and re-open the app.
